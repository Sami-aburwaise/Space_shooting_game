## Describtion

The objective of this project is to create a browser game. The game is similer to old space fighting alien shooting games.

The game is hosted [here.](https://spaceshooting.surge.sh/)

### Features

* Space shooting game features a multiple levels of fighting ships.

* Multiple control keys for compability.

* Game statistics for competition.

* stable 40 frames per second.

### How to Get Started

Read [project requirements](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEI-06-Bahrain/SEI-Info/tree/main/Lessons/Week02/Day04/u1_project_prompt) for the game and plan what features are in the game and lay them down in Trello.


#### The game into these sections:

* render

* game logic

* user input


all these sections in the code are excuted every frame using [setInterval](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp) methode.
```
myInterval = setInterval(function, milliseconds);
```


### render

To render the game a png or gif images is used.


<img src='images/projectile.png' width = 20%>
<img src='images/explode.gif' width = 50%>


Every frame the game logic decide what position the image is going to be based on game logic and user input.

#### moving stuff around

Moving the ship is just relocating or render the same image few pixels away every frame.

![element box diagram](/images/element-box-diagram.png)

get the current position

```this.render.getBoundingClientRect('position').left```

next position is **entity.speed** pixels away from current position


### game logic

Since the same positioning and moving functions are needed for all the moving stuff in the game a class named **Entity** is created with these functionalities.



```
entity.xposition()  //get position in horizontal axis

entity.yposition()  //get position in vertical axis

entity.move(x, y, bordered = true)  //move object to (x,y)
```

The **Entity** class is extended to other classes to create objects with diffrent properties such as shooting and death animation.

* player

* enemy

* projectile




#### Collision

For detecting collisions the distance between the ship and all the projectiles in the game is calculated every frame.


### user input

Every frame the state of the input is checked then the corresponds action is excuted.

The state of the input is changed only when the event is occured.

## wireframe

This is simple wireframe of the desired website.

![wire frame](wireFrame.png)

The website has two html pages. The main page showing the title and color select option. The other is to run the game logic and render.
