# Browser game project

## Describtion

The objective of this project is to create a browser game. The game is similer to old space fighting alien shooting games as shown below.

### How to Get Started
read requirements for the game and plan what features are in the game.

#### Project Requirements (MVP)
**Your project must:**
- Be a **new repo**. Create a new repo in your GitHub and build your project there. **DO NOT** name your repository Project 1. Give it a real name.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **README.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)
- Include a minimum of **2 HTML pages** and navigation between them
- Include a minimum of **2 event handlers**
- Have at least **20** _meaningful_ `git` commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments, if in your code at all, should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
- Display proper use of global variables and function parameters (function scopes)
- Use camelCase for JavaScript variables
- Be deployed on [Surge](https://surge.sh/) (We will cover this on Wednesday of project week)
- Remove console.logs before deploying
